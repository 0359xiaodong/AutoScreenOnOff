# PowerOff
*an android widget to turn on/off screen automatically by detecting values from proximity sensor*
a handy app for devices of which power button is hard to reach or users who don't want to access power H/W button that often.

### How it works
- if it's first added to home launcher and pressed, it will ask for Device Admin's privilege in order to access this feature from device.
- if user accepts the privilege, it will start to detect whether the screen should be on or off based on the value from proximity sensor
